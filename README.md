# tdd-examples
## TDD playground for relatively complex test cases.

Install, read method descriptions in `BusinessLogic.js`, remove or comment implementation and try to get to the same or better by the Test First approach.
<br/><br/>
The system is fully isolated, all dependencies are inverted, testing system is set up (mocha-chai tdd assertion style). I'm too lazy to declare contract in some d.ts file, so try to imply it from code.

Installation:

```
git clone git@github.com:trofima/tdd-examples.git

cd tdd-examples

npm i

```

If you don't like something - I don't care.
If you want to suggest some tricky case, create a PR or an issue.
