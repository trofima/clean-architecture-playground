Opinionated example of how you can apply SOLID principles and CA to UI Web development. Based on Uncle Bob Martin Clean Architecture and Functional Design books.
The examples are not intended to be "true" FP, since true FP is readable only to chosen ones. The intent is make it conceivable to everyone.
